/**
 * DESCRIPTION: <br>
 * Provides an API for FRC 1736 Robot Casserole datalogging on the robot during
 * testing or matches. Will write lines into a CSV file with a unique name
 * between calls to init() and close(). output_dir is hardcoded to point to a
 * specific 2016 folder on a flash drive connected to the roboRIO. <br>
 * <br>
 * USAGE:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Instantiate Class</li>
 * <li>Create global variables containing arrays of strings to represent the
 * column (data vector) names and units</li>
 * <li>During teleop init or autonomous init, call the init() function to start
 * logging data to a new file.</li>
 * <li>Once per loop, call the writeData() method with the full list of values
 * to write to file (all must be converted to doubles).</li>
 * <li>During DisabledInit, call the close() method to close out any file which
 * was being written to while the robot was doing something.</li>
 * <li>Post-match or -practice, extract the data logs from the USB drive(maybe
 * using FTP?) and view with excel or your favourite software.</li>
 * </ol>
